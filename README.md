## How To Use
- Download or clone this repository
- Open command prompt, ensure you have NodeJS installed
- Via command prompt navigate to the downloaded folder using `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list)
- open index.js in your favorite code editor (or notepad) and change the options on the first few lines, I would recommend only tracking either a profile or video and not both as TikTok has some pretty harsh rate limiting
![Options](https://github.com/Adsnipers/tiktok_live_stats/images/optionsExample.png)
- run the command `npm start` in CMD (make sure you're in the correct directory or it wont work)
